# FastIPScan

This little script developed in Batch is focused for the Windows operating system in order to use it as a CMD command.

## Info about the script

I will briefly present the script with the following information:

1. What is about?
    - It is a script that allows you to know at any time your IP and network state, you can provide both your public IP and on the network.
    - To be able to use it as its own command, you must follow instructions.
2. What steps need to be taken?
    - When downloading the "FastIPScan.bat" file this must be taken to a specific route
    - That route is "C:\Windows\System32"
    - Once the file is on that route then it can be used as a normal command, test writing at the CMD "FastIPScan"
3. Execution examples
